Deluded,"Delusions of grandure and self important tripe. Its a disgrace to all real footballers who went before him. Its a disgrace to humans that work 9 to 5 for a fraction of what this guy earns in a week. Avoid, don't feed his over inflated ego.",,Negative
Self obsessed sob story,"Worst documentary I've ever watched. Que the sad music, play acting in front of the camera, dabbing, add some family sadness (but I'll get that recorded instead of privacy). Agent compares himself to Jesus, and we all know what a piece of work he was. ""Manchester will always be special to me"" and then slates the club and that ""nothing"" offer of 300k per week.

His agent, christ milking it even more what a hard life he lives.

Thank god for Manchester United the drama is over. Juventus have that problem now.",,Negative
This guy is deluded and drinking his own sauce wayyy too much,"""Wherever he goes, he's shining...like a walking star hahahahhaahahahaha what drugs have these lot been taking, I want some! He's a walking clown who's been overpaid and suffers delusions of grandeur as we see throughout the series. He was let go by Sir Alex Ferguson who knew he was rotten to the core. I used to argue that Mourinho should've tried to inspire him but his arrogance is over inflated what the teams he has played in have achieve (note the words I used, they are not achievements as a result of Paul Pogba being in those teams), so Jose would never have been able to get anything out of him, just like OGS and Rangnick. He's an embarrassment to people of colour, he makes us look lazy, he lack the ability to take his responsibility seriously, as a POC, as a man, as a supposed leader and as a footballer who was paid vast sums of money to walk around. You could argue it is the French in him and he needs to feel the love but Cantona was similar except he earnt the love and adoration every single time he stepped on the pitch. Even when he was sent off, he brought a sense of pride to it but this clown shows how low a human being can go pointing the finger at everyone else...it's always everyone else and never himself.

If anyone in normal job trying to survive performed the way he does and has as you see, the way he behaves, the serious lack of focus and dedication to changing his and the teams fortune...you wouldn't last more than 3-6 months but this guy says he deserved a pay rise... This documentary is the worst case of gaslighting we will experience courtesy of Paul Pogba and the awful Amazon team who already have a shoddy reputation that is worse off by making this.",,Negative
Hhahahahahahahaha!!!!!!,"What an awful documentary by a jumped up narcissist ?300.000 is nothing apparently, if this was a comedy I'd have given it a 10 but unfortunately he genuinely thinks he's world class, the mind boggles!!",,Negative
Don't understand Amazon's motive,"How can a documentary be this bad, totally unexpected from a platform like Amazon. Really poorly structured and a total waste of time. Clear avoid for anyone who hasn't watched this .",,Negative
Absolute legend,"Brilliant. How, just how do you possibly average 1.0/10 from (as of writing) 6000 reviews. This is insane.

By being Paul Pogba is the answer to that question! How a human can be so out of touch with it's fellow humans is incredible. Madness. He has over 55milion followers, how has he possibly managed to alienate almost literally EVERYONE who watched this mess? How has he made something SO bad, even his millions of followers haven't watched and mustered up even the few not 1.0 reviews to save it from being the worst rated steaming pile of dog turd ever created?

I am in awe of this man and this documentary and how bad it is.",,Negative
Utter self-serving drivel,"An egotistical, self-important cry baby- that would be a much better title for this absolute nonsense. Pogba represents the worst excesses of the modern footballer; all style and no substance. He's the only one who believes his own hype. Give this a miss.",,Negative
Pogone!,"The virus and the leaker of the dressing room finally gone, digging his own grave with this documentary. You'd love to see it.

You can see that both Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho were right about the player. Most of United fans including myself has been a supporter of him, even against Mourinho but thank to this documentary, we proved wrong.

This documentary opened our eyes that, maybe, if not absolutely, after all, the manager is always right about their players.",,Negative
If I could give 0 rating I woukd,Shocking turned off after 5 mins as constantly chatting ?? all about himself. Don't care about anyone else. Me !! Me !! Me !! Saying how a hazing he thinks he is. Why don't he get real pundits so they can tell the truth about him ??,,Negative
I'd give it a zero if I could,This guy is one of the biggest self promoting hacks on the planet. Don't waste your time or the electricity by watching this. I'd rather lick my own armpit.,,Negative
Pogboom to Pogshame,"He smiles a lot but he was such a bad vibe for the club. No respect whatsoever for the club, supporter. ManUtd paid a lot to get him back - and this is what they've got. Such a shame. Pogboom is such a Pogshame.",,Negative
Terrible,"Horrific to watch, the delusion is strong with this one. I hope he is getting less than 300k a week at Juve and thank god he didn't accept our stupid offer.",,Negative
Me Me Me Me Me Me,What a load of dross. Each episode lasts slightly longer than 1 of his ridiculous hairstyles. One of the worst signings United have ever made. I see his documentary ratings are higher than his playing ones?,,Negative
Selfish and obsessed with money,,,Negative
Self Obsessed Person,"Just saying good things about himself. Let people say good things, no he is busy praising himself in the whole documentry ????. This documentary is a joke.",,Negative
Utter scutter,"No responsibility taken for any bad results, it's everyone else's problem. The man is a virus and this documentary sees him full of his own importance. ?300k is nothing yet he's going to sign for Juve for half that, let this be the end of him now.",,Negative
Reflects Pogba's life,"Pogba's very existence has been to paint a picture of himself as being a star when the reality of it is that he was average at best.

In this sorry series, which certainly doesn't qualify as a documentary, the same story appears. An attempt at blowing his own trumpet but in reality just blowing smoke up people's backsides.

If you listen to Pogba, he won the world cup on his own. Didn't need 10 other blue shirts

2022 he played just a fraction of the team's matches, produced one goal, one man of the match display.",,Negative
U should be ashamed of how u treated man united,A true leader is the one that lead his team at there baddest moments not a one that pretend to be a leader with a team full of superstars(french national team) u just made it worse for united with ur childish attitude and ur agent(RIP) comments..at the end I hope all the best for your future paul.,,Negative
The 'Stinkementary',"Wow, where do I start on this!

This is by far the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen in my life!

Paul Pogba should be jailed for crimes against football and TV, I would rather paint my eyeballs turquoise and watch the paint dry on my eyeballs than watch this trash again, also I hate the colour turquoise.",,Negative
A self obsession sob story,"Wondering who thought it was a good idea to try and sell self obsession story of an over rated, abomination of a human being. There are narcissistic tendancies and then there are destroy everything on the way narcissistic tendencies. This falls into the latter. A thoroughly disgusting watch.",,Negative
Arrogant Spoiled child. Disgrace Amazon gave him a show,"How on earth does someone look at paul pogba as someone worthy of any documentary?

What a waste of money.

This man is trash. His circle is trash.

He doesn't appreciate anything and thinks he's entitled to the world

You kick a ball when you're not faking injuries dude. You're not making the world a better place. And this show just proves that.",,Negative
Bad example to future an disgrace to past footballers,"Self promoting brand , all this guy ever cares about is his image , a failed spell in EPL an he makes this to excuse himself from himself and blame others. Those that gives it more then 1 star are trollers an probably didn't watch it.",,Negative
Pogoff,,,Neutral
"Couldn't put zero stars, hence 1","Thanks for leaving united Paul. See you at some charity games with some legends maybe. The childish attitude is fit for games like those.

Shame you had to drag Sir Alex into this.",,Negative
Where's the zero?,"I watched this mainly out of morbid curiosity, I never liked the guy but thought something in here might make him more of a relatable guy or atleast a guy I can respect.

For way too long he was considered ""cool"" kids everywhere looking up to him and mimicking some of the stupidest things like the dab etc.

Terms like world class, legend and GOAT get thrown out way too easily, he's had performances or spells at that level but as a career with most of it being in Italy and the United stuff being so bad there is no way he should be considered that now.

I mean imagine being so deluded to call 300k nothing with the state of the world post pandemic, another sign of how backwards everything is, football needs moderating and capping at a certain top level and end this greed. He will no doubt donate to charity or some other PR rubbish to deflect from this massacre.

He's a Narcissistic, vain, vapid and arrogant mess, you can tell he's nice on his terms if stuff goes his way, if not then his true self comes out, the problem with this whole thing is he's so surrounded by yes men, no one told him how stupid this was. The one pro is he seems to bond better with his kids than those awkward moments in the ronaldo documentary.

The other issue is this ignores every negative thing he's done, it cherry picks stuff and is designed to make him appear in a good light, but too many people can see through that, he's an awful influence, has a poor attitude and is a rubbish professional, wants an easy ride and with no shadow of a doubt if he screws up at juve he will either sit and collect or go to psg.

He had so much potential and he's won alot no doubt but if I was him I'd firstly be disappointed that my legacy is caveated with so many poor seasons but public opinion and now a documentary showing what a rubbish human being he is.

Charity workers, doctors nurses, teachers, firemen, police, not all obviously but these guys are the heroes who deserve more money and to be held up as role models, not a creating with awful hair that can occasionally kick a ball well. Without the money aswell no one is looking at this guy as attractive.",,Negative
World class ??,"The epitome of the modern day footballer and then a bit more. A man with a decent talent at football, simply unwilling to understand his limitations. Blaming everyone else for his mistakes and ultimately being a sicknote because he couldn't handle the heat. An embarrassment wearing the badge. Jog on. Although that may be a bit high tempo.",,Negative
Premise of the movie is confusing,"A terrible attempt to milk Manchester United. Series has poor quality, and I am sad that I wasted my time to watch this. I tried to make sense of what was happening, but all I can make out of it is a player that tries to justify how bad he was.

Stay off it!",,Negative
Terrible player who loves money,"No passion for the club, just performs at closed camp and is manipulated by an obese Italian agent trying to milk money out of him which he can't see.",,Negative
"Excellent player, terrible attitude.","Can't even be bothered to write a review, much like PP when he steps on a pitch.

So here's my 150 remainimg characters ..........................................",,Negative
Shows his true self,First its the lack of effort then it's not stopping outspoken people then saying he's not been offered anything for a contract when he was on 300k.... come on he should have been earning 30 k if that for his diabolical performances. Go and be a clown else where.,,Negative
Out of touch with reality,"What an absolute waste of time. The guy is so out of touch with reality. Part time footballer, full time clown it seems. Good riddance. I find it hilarious that no other big team wanted to go anywhere near him. I bet he thought he'd have offers from around the world. He is everything that is wrong with a modern day footballer. Caring way too much about his own brand, which sucks imo, instead of actual footballing ability and results. The complete antithesis of a Manchester United player. Not fit to wear the shirt.",,Negative
Can we give a ZERO STAR RATING ?!?,"Well overpaid clown, he is exactly what's wrong with football these days!

Disgusting mentality and a lazy player, way too arrogant and deluded, 20 years ago players like him would've been playing in the second league.",,Negative
The Pogmentary,I am a Manchester United fan and I was so offended by what Pogba said about Manchester Untied. It clear Pogba hate Manchester United and Manchester United fans.,,Negative
Instagram footballer,"Cares more about instagram pictures than football.

The problem with these modern day footballers . They have huge inflated egos and think they are something special.

This guy has been a massive flop at united.",,Negative
Shallow Rubbish,"Honestly the most conceited, shallow, self obsessed moron in sport. Have to watch it to believe it. If there was a negative star rating I would have gladly given it. I'm not even a sports fan but figured it couldn't be as bad as everyone was saying, I was way wrong.",,Negative
Egotistical Pr1ck,"Pathetic excuse for a documentary. This is more interesting than this documentary.

Parasitic,The guy literally is a parasite....knows the price of everything but the value of nothing...told he was worth more than he was by another parasite and sold what little dignity he may have had left to star and I say that loosely in this self indulgent tripe. A footballer that believes his own hype that much that he thinks he is going to stroll back into the Juve midfield and run the show. Please televise that fall from grace for the fans that paid to watch this reality TV s?&t show in action.,,Negative
Just awful. Narcissistic feeding their ego.,"Pombal seems to have a god complex about himself. For someone who dubs themselves as world class, there is nothing class about him. Mediocre at best on the pitch for the majority and more focused on the Pogba ""brand"". Don't waste your time by watching this self indulgent tripe.",,Negative
"Just hype and nothing else, just like his entire football career","This is just another hype he has managed to create about himself. He is just an average football player with a great PR team that tries to convince the world that he is some magician lol. He is injury prone and so much self-centered, he is more of a celebrity than a football player, he has more creativity in his hair styles than on the pitch.",,Negative
The Perfect Modern Football,"Egotistical, overrated, definitely overpaid, lazy, bad attitude the perfect example of why I no longer watch football. Pogba spends more time in the mirror than training for the next game. The guy thinks he's some sort of god.",,Negative
5 Episodes too long,"Not a ManUtd fan, so for reasons I can't even justify to myself was hoping to endure the viewing & get some meat or substance from the player's point of view.

Utter dross PR tool all of it enabled by Amazon.",,Negative
1-star is far too much for this subject matter,"He couldn't give United 90 minutes in 6 years, definitely not worth 2.5 hours. Not even worth the trailer. It's not even worth this review. A waste of money, a waste of time, a waste of space.",,Negative
Deserved even less,"He has won one World Cup. He's a fantastic talent. But this documentary shows what he is as a person. One of the worst signing in the history of Manchester United.

And those who haven't watched the documentary, STAY AWAY from it !!!",,Negative
namsume,"Suck it up, take your side.

. Paul's life shouldn't be a documentary. It's not bad at all. In addition to having a good mouth and cutting hair every day. Documentary It's for legends, which is not you.",,Negative
Joke,"Head on to Liverpool's YouTube. Go watch Jordan Henderson documentary for 30mins and come back to this.

Stark difference. Trust me and do it. You can see the sheer difference between a leader and a clown.",,Negative
Pogbye,The worst thing I've seen on TV this year so far. It's just him parading around like a peacock thinking he's done it all and has it all. He thinks so highly of himself as a footballer but never does anything really to reinforce that on the pitch. He will never be remembered as one of the greats. He'd be lucky to be remembered at all.,,Negative
Don't bother,"Quite possibly the worst sports documentary I have ever seen or has ever been made, and the less I say about the star of the show the better, overpaid, over hyped and garbage.",,Negative
"Drogba ends wars, Pogba starts them",This man is a mental patient. I don't even need to specify what's bad about the show because it's easily the worst thing anyone has ever made. Good to see instead of helping the poor with his wages Pogba spends it on a show we all hatd.,,Negative
A true love story between Pogba and Pogba,"If this guy loved himself any more it would be incest. If you want to watch a documentary full of excuses why a player with all the ability in the world failed to materialise into a top class player then this will be exactly your type of programme. If you want to know the true story just look on his social media account, you will see mor me haircuts and sully dances than anything football related. This guy is a joke, he will go down as one of the biggest transfer flops in history:",,Negative
A terrible and pathetic documentary!,"This is one of the worst documentaries I have ever seen. Its so obvious that this is a PR stunt and his so called audition for his dream of being an actor when he is done with football, which is said already in the first episode.

Having said that it's also just so tragic and sad that he can't see himself how out of place and self-aggrandising this is. He is being revealed as an overpaid and egotistical little child who only has yes people around him, and playing the victim he can also do when United ?only? gives him a new contract proposal of 290000 ? a week and called it nothing, so maybe there still is hope for an acting career.

Good documentaries lets the documentarist have free reins and tell the true, full and objektive story, and that is obviously not done here. It's also kind of hilarious how all these young famous people nowadays think they have life wisdom to share in a documentary when they aren't even 30 years old, and if not that its just to show off their life and thats even worse. I am starting to understand Mourinho and why he said Pogba had a negative influence in the dressing room. All in all I guess its just sad. He has all that money, a beautiful family and accomplished the dream of millions of people around the world, being a pro fotballer, and still he has the need for more attention and fame. I would say he is an example of how society in the west these days is totally F'd up. Nothing is ever enough and all that matters is fame, money, attention, ugly but expensive clothes and weird haircuts. It makes me sad, but I am glad he is no longer a Manchester United player, and come to think of it he never really was.",,Negative
Imbecile!,"This so called footballer has lived off hype that was created before he came back to Man Utd at a great cost... ?95 million transfer.

?360,000 pw in salary + who knows what extras.

And he's done absolutely zero for the club.

He's full of his own hype, self importance and entitlement.

Watch him on the pitch and before long you realise just how lazy he is.

Whoever commissioned this documentary obviously was sucked into the same hype.

I'm never heard such verbal diarrhoea (aside from Boris Johnson and his cronies) from any footballer.

Next time someone has a 'bright' idea to spend our money, especially on a footballer for a documentary, have a word with yourself.",,Negative
Beyond delusional,"The most deluded man ever to walk the earth. He's a total clown.

Lack of self awareness is truly amazing.

I will be amazed if he has a sponsor not desperate to drop him.

Instagram footballer is all he is.",,Negative
Dont waste your time!,"Just a self obsessed bloke trying to play the sob story. The epitome of a deluded modern day Instagram footballer.

If being offered $300 Per week is nothing. Try doing a normal job where you might earn that in 10 years.

If del boy was around... It would be a very loud.. you plonker Rodney!

Wants to prove us all wrong by showing what we're missing.... He has been missing for 6 years which is when her should have been proving himself!",,Negative
Top Selfish & Virus called by Jose,,,Neutral
If I could give it 0 I would,"The guy is so full of himself, does he think the world evolves around him.

He may have the biggest head in football but certainly not the biggest talent.

Wherever he ends up, he won't be on as much as the ""nothing"" offer he laughed off, history will show it was a better deal than he will get elsewhere.

Some other footballers documentaries you can watch even if you don't like them, and still appreciate the mindset and the talent of the player. This is definitely not one of those, Pogba has no redeeming characteristics at all.",,Negative
Trash. That's it,"Trash player, trash mentality, trash documentary.

How do you have the audacity to release a documentary after the worst season for him and the team. He's busy being on camera on parties and barbershops rather than practicing on the field.",,Negative
Pogba is trash,"Awful, awful, just terrible. You just finished 6th with Manchester United, you were a part of a club worst season ever in the Premier League and you get to film a documentary like this?

Pogba is the definition of a wasted player, talented yes, but lacks work ethic and concentration.",,Negative
The worst,"The most hideously overrated footballer in history. A despicable attitude and an empty shirt on the pitch. Good riddance. To have an ego this big and to never, ever back it up with hard work or effort is scandalous.",,Negative
Pogflop,I tried for 7 minutes and decided I've had enough. Similar to Paul Pogba's final appearance for Man United against Liverpool. Pogback to a different show I go.,,Negative
"Moan, moan, moan","If there was a balloon d'or for whining like a b*tch Pogba would be a serial winner. He and his agent epitomise everything that is wrong with football and how the big money in the beautiful game has created a culture of greed, selfishness and entitlement. Do yourself a favour and don't bother wasting your time on this nonsense.",,Negative
Poorgmentary,"As a supporter I was excited for him to get second lease of life at the club. In return, we got a player who was injury prone, did his rehabs in Dubai and the US, whilst meeting all his glamour mates. Didn't once brush off rumours about his future when asked, clearly disrespected the club and supporters with responses. How does he expect the backing from the supporters? And to top it off, a poor documentary to hog all the spotlight, yet again.

Let us see if he can back himself up with his new club. That will tell us a whole new story, or maybe one we already knew.",,Negative
Moaning of a Narcissistic Idiot. B O R I N G! D I S A S T E R!,"The whole concept of making a documentary about Paul Pogba is a stupid stupid decision. He isn't even a world class footballer. He peaked for a year playing for France. Since then, it's been all downhill. This show has no meat. It's trying to cash in on Manchester United. That's it.

If you don't hate Pogba yet, give this a watch. You'll see how disconnected with reality is this idiot.",,Negative
Jesus...,"Wow this guy has an over inflated ego...i mean we all knew it but he had a couple of good seasons at Juventus, which is an easier league but he actually thinks hes the best player in the world...not even top 50 in a decent league and its like pogba+scientology!",,Negative
Utter garbage,Never seen so much rubbish coming out of someone's mouth. This is what is wrong with football today and certainly what's gone wrong with Man United; signing self-entitled players who think they should earn before they learn or even play fairly well. The gumption to make a movie about himself when he had ZERO IMPACT at United is astounding. Shame shame shame.,,Negative
From a juve fan,"Gosh. I see 2 type of people reviewing here, ones are united fan who rate it 1/10, rest are united haters who rate it 10/10,both group probably didnt bother to watch this docu.

Well, its not for every one. It will be really watched by french football fans, juve fans and pogba fans. Rest all are just reviewing it.

I am not a pogba fan. Pog is immensely talented but he's not like pirlo. He cant perform everywhere. Plus he is a modern day footballer. So you often see him trying different things with his hair and fashion. I wish he could try different things on pitch some day. Well i will rate him as 7/10 as a footballer.

Now lets comes to this documentary. I love watching football docu and movies. This show does not stand anywhere near that. I enjoyed messi's even though i dont know a word of spanish. This is not a documentary. It was probably pog's agent's idea or his PR's idea to make a docu on pog so that he could explain why he failed miserably in EPL.

Any person who has slightest idea of football would know that pog is a relaxed no. 6. He likes to control the midfield when hard pressing is absent. But games in EPL is very fast paced. Players like pog would always fail there plus united was not in best shape too.

Guys please rate this docu after watching it. Dont show your love or hate for United here.

Forza Juve

PS: ppl voting it 10/10 and saying all 1/10 reviewers are United fans..lol guys. Overall rating of this docu is 1/10. United really is most popular club in the world even after 9 years they have been not playing as per their level. Being a juve fan I feel envious to United now.",,Negative
Forgettable,"Much like the player himself, this is a largely forgettable, cheap attempt at fame. Complete waste of time talent and money. This film is essentially a stroke of the ego of Paul Pogba. I have never seen a person so unremarkable crave attention and celebrity.",,Negative
Unwatchable,Kids haven't stopped crying since it finished. Avoid at all costs! Marginally better than Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace but not quite as good as stepping on a piece of Lego.,,Negative
Awful commercial tripe,"Never had there been such pompous manufactured rubbish about a bang average player with an inflated ego, there's no substance to this ""documentary"" whatsoever.",,Negative
What a waste of money on documentary,"For such an overrated, lousy, self centred and greedy player, why waste the time and resources on him instead of channeling the money and resources to a more useful cause or even a more deserving player?

Over 6 years, i cannot remember how many small and handful of games when he really played well and yet he dare to make big demands. If anything, this documentary reinforced what most people know about Pogba already. A total waste of everything. Don't even bother wasting a few hours of your life on this guy. Even writing this review on Pogmentary is a waste of my time but I felt a duty to inform the rest about this greedy fella.",,Negative
I watched 5 minutes and want those 5 minutes back.,,,Neutral
Nothing to see here.,Pogba being pogba crying when he can't do anything and rarely when he does anything he dances. Whining every time. Focusing less on football and concentrating on every thing else that's pogba. Even calling it a pogmentary shows how obsessed you are with everything besides football.,,Negative
Terrible player,"Absolutely terrible person and an even worse player 1/10 just like his performances on the pitch lmao Pogboom to Pogshame He smiles a lot but he was such a bad vibe for the club. No respect whatsoever for the club, supporter. ManUtd paid a lot to get him back and this is what they've got. Such a shame. Pogboom is such a Pogshame.

The 'Stinkementary' where do I start on this!

This is by far the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen in my life!

Paul Pogba should be jailed for crimes against football and TV, I would rather paint my eyeballs turquoise and watch the paint dry on my eyeballs than watch this trash again.",,Negative
Absolute rubbish!,This biggest lot of drivel from a self centred "superstar". The biggest mooch of a player going and quite possibly the biggest waste of a wage going. He thinks he's so hard done by.,,Negative
A stupid pig with no thought or professional ethics.,"Pobga is 29 years old. During his six years at Manchester United, he showed the rebellion of teenagers. When Boba was 26, he became a father. He won the World Cup, Serie A and Europa League. He participated in the Champions League final, and he became one of the most profitable players in football. However, he is like a child who dares not look up when adults quarrel. Boba has the talent and ability to become a top player, and Kong Di has inspired his potential. Jean-Claude can also get Bogba into submission. But in Manchester United, Bogba is immature. He is like a giant baby, like a rebellious teenager.",,Negative
Egotistical sob story,"Just him and his agent moaning about united. Overrated player, more bothered about his image than actually playing football. Acting like United owe him everything, when he only turned up when he felt like it.",,Negative
ha ha,"So funny i dont think that i have laughed this much ever one of the best comedy series of all time.

I recommend it its better than friends, the office and HIMUM.",,Negative
PogWho?,"Lazy money grabber who thinks he's more than what he is. Says all he wants to do is play football yet he didn't sign a new deal because it wasn't enough money? Even after the fact he's had the worst 6 years of his career.

This guy and his representatives are poison to the beautiful game. Good riddens.",,Negative
"he should stick to football, at least there he can steal all the money he wants","Worst acting possible, the music.... , what are you making a documentary for bro? You havent done anything in your career individually... you dont even run in games, you are a disgrace for the sport and all that came before you to make a documentary of yourself when you dont event have passion for the game, just as this film lacks soul and passion, I just made myself an account to criticize this pseudofilm. Mr pogba you are delusional and youre getting 1 star just because I cant give you 0.",,Negative
A whole documentary sucking himself off,"A very talented but inconsistent , lazy and egotistical player . He has no credentials to have a documentary. His only saving grace in his career is that he played next to Ngolo Kante in the world cup. As for the documentary it is just him praising himself for nothing.",,Negative
Awful,"This whole thing is a narcissistic ego massaging exercise from a self important idiot who has no idea how lucky he is and has no sense of perspective.

Awful title for a documentary and an awful subject for a documentary. I am honestly baffled how this garbage has seen the light of day. How anybody involved thought they would come off looking good from this is beyond me.",,Negative
Absolute nonsense,I really do enjoy sports documentaries but this is utter tripe. It's as if he made a documentary that only he would enjoy purely to stroke his ego. I've never been a pogba fan to be honest but after watching this I have nothing but contempt for him.,,Negative
Wow what a mercenary,"Well shot and good production but seriously shows how much of a money grabber and ego the man is.

For a footballer who only plays at 10% most of the time until it's something that benefits him as an individual, scoffing at ?300k a week as 'nothing' really makes you despise him.",,Negative
Not worth a watch,Terrible show of grandeur and self importance. Waste of money. He thinks too highly of himself. If would give it 0 stars if I could. He needs to put in more effort in his football rather than this popularity thing.,,Negative
Too pompous and too Lazy to contribute to his team's success,"He is way to proud and doesn't work much to help his team. He is not the type of player one would need his team as he can't add no value to it.

Should have chose dancing instead of football.",,Negative
RUBBISH,"Would have give 0 if I could.

Absolutely rubbish.

Rubbish career attitude, rubbish personality, rubbish educated, rubbish manner, a piece of trash that all the rubbish things you can think of.",,Negative
Cry Baby,5 episodes of a grown man crying about wanting to be loved whilst earning millions and putting in no effort. Would not waste your time watching this as it is 2 and a half hours you will not get back.,,Negative
Fwrgoe knew,Not watched it and never will. Fergie warned United about this player and agent. A true virus and poor footballer. Will never be considered a great player in the football world.,,Negative
A dog behaves better,"Pogba's talent is inversely proportional tohis personality. He is a mercenary, obedient andhard-working when there is a leader on the team,but he can't resist his desire to be a leader. Whenasked to lead a team, he would just tear it apart.",,Negative
"Incredible lack of awareness - just when you think it can't get any worse, it does.","Paul Pogba will go down as one of the most overrated footballers in the history of the game, and this documentary shows why. Whilst Pogba has incredible talent, his ridiculous ego, self entitlement and lack of respect will always hinder him.

Not many players with such talent will manage to fail at the greatest club in the world, yet Paul did. In this documentary he also shows an astonishing lack of awareness with regards to his own performances and incredible delusion about his career. Credit where it is due, Pogba was very good in the World Cup win for France. However, Jose Mourinho summed up perfectly the reason for his success. No distractions, perfect conditions to focus only on *football* for a limited period of time with the eyes of the world on the sport. This is the kind of environment he can succeed in. However, when the backs are against the wall and you need to show fight and character, Paul Pogba has failed to show these attributes. No doubt he will win trophies at Juventus, a successful and dominant team in a much easier league, it will mean nothing however. There is no achievement to be found there, only half challenges and easy victories.

Overrated, overpaid, self-indulged, blissfully unaware of his own shortcomings and downright ignorance and disrespect towards an institution who contributed greatly to the player and person he is. This documentary shows it all, and I fear it has had the opposite effect for Pauls image than he had intended.",,Negative
Somehow worse then his performances,"Self absorbed person makes documentary about being a self absorbed money hungry person. If you dislike him already watching this will only make it worse, although his acting is incredible so maybe a career in theatre is the way to go for Paul.",,Negative
It is the biography of a fraud that trick an entire club into thinking he is a worlc class,The story is about a guy that loves haircuts and enjoy dancing on the pitch. Also like to go jogging in the big important matches. He is an inspiration becuase he managed to get fire three managers from their job.,,Negative
"Terrible player, terrible documentary",Everything that is wrong with the modern game. More concerned with haircuts than playing. I will give him credit for continuing to con people into thinking he's a world class player. He's not and can only play well for about 6 games a season.,,Negative
Don't waste your time,"What an absolute pathetic ""documentary"", I mean this bloke has done absolutely nothing other than win a World Cup in an amazing French team.

Overpaid, Insta wannabe famous cr*p footballer, more hairstyles than goals and more egos than trophies, absolute disgrace to all the decent hardworking people out there and decent footballers who actually give a damn about their club, the bloke is a parasite ??",,Negative
The Story of a self obsessed snob,"History doesn't have place or patience for cry babies, specially the unprofessional ones. Wish his boots were as big as his ego.

No one has time for his self gloating , they wanted to see his skills which were absent for the best part of his time at United. It's all about I, me, myself.",,Negative
Not worth wasting your time on,"Waste of time, nothing special about it , it shows the personality and the parallel world Paul lives in , he can't see the truth about himself, he does not admit his mistakes , he ask to get what he does not deserve

It is just showing his bad personality.",,Negative
Complete clown,Worse documentary I've ever seen if you can call it that AVOID!!!! I've never seen such big baby on screen before wouldn't surprise me if he wore a nappy 24/7.,,Negative
Embarrassing,There should not be room on the tv for someone like Pogba. The title of the programme tells you all you need to know about his ego. What a load of rubbish this was.,,Negative
Brand over substance,"Sadly this is just what I'd expect from Pogba.

A thin facade barely hiding his insane selfishness, passive aggressive personality and obsession with his personal brand.

How can a player who's contributed so little to any collective efforts, including his national team, get so much attention?

All hype.",,Negative
Football Arrogance,Self centered pile of rubbish. Adds nothing to improve his reputation. Everything you hate about overpaid privileged footballer demonstrated in this documentary.,,Negative

Clown-o-metry!,"Boooo!

A story of a rotten egg who should have never been called back once he had despised his own club.

Pogba is a story of an arrogant footballer who had great potentials but failed to live upto them because of his attitude.",,Negative
"Pogba, if you read this, let me thank you for joining juventus, cause you were never good enough to play for the great manchester united.","Pogba, if you read this, let me thank you for joining juventus, cause you were never good enough to play for the great manchester united. The worst player ever, so inflated and overrated. Your ego is the only big thing you have.",,Negative
Egoist Fellow,Barely watched in 10 minutes i was full. Nothing new in this crap more about money and money about his hair styles. Not worth a watch. Zero motivation for football.,,Negative
He is just a cheap clown though he earns a lot!,"He may be one of the most talented football players in the world in our era, however is really a trouble-maker in the locker-room. I think he has no specific target in playing real football but doing anything else to make others impressed with his hair styles. He doesn't deserve the overprice and fans' expect right now.

Hope that he will come back with the true desire of playing football, less of injury and will help his club achieve success.",,Negative
Joke of a player/person,"If there was ever evidence needed that some footballers are out of touch with reality then this is, the money he has earned is a joke and to demand more is disgusting! He kicks a ball for a living and isn't even good at that, but expects everyone to fall at his feet like he's a god or one of the greats like Messi or Ronaldo without actually earning it or putting in the work. So glad he's left United, waste of space!!",,Negative
Delusional and misleading,"If Pogba put quarter of the effort he puts into advertising himself as a decent footballer, he'd probably be a decent footballer. Paints himself as an icon or a ""legend"" when he has achieved nothing on his own in is career with all his assumed glory being a product of other people's hard work. Felt like watching a documentary for one of the substitutes in Maradona's 1986 Argentina team celebrating himself as a World Cup champion. Cringe-worthy.",,Negative
Pogba likes Pogba.,"A Series about : How Paul Pogba thinks about Paul Pogba.

Wasted Talent, stupid Haircuts. Overhyped, Overrated, overpriced and toooooo much overpaid.

Suggested name for the Series "" A child that doesn't want to be a man""",,Neutral
Terrible,,,Neutral
Self entitled,Self entitled megalomaniac with delusions of grandeur and a very average footballer. Cares more about his different hairstyles than his actual work on the pitch.,,Negative
The Virus,"Mourinho said it , ""Pogba is a virus not a team player "" , Overrated Player with Overprice , maybe can be model or hairstyle something like that, but he is not team player, I don't know who think about this series but it's really bad and ugly idea.",,Negative
Deluded,"Nothing to say just glad he's finally left Manchester United. Goodbye to your laziness, unprofessionalism, rudeness, abusive behavior. Juventus he's your problem now. And please don't ever come back to Manchester United.",,Negative
This is the only thing worse than his United career,When Paul Pogba looks back and realises Tom Cleverley had a better united career than him he might realise he was the problem. This documentary is the only thing worse than his man United career.,,Negative
Just An Overrated Football Player Desperately Holding On To Any Relevancy And Looks Like a Deluded Man,Absolutely rubbish documentary. Dont see any point in making it. Just a Deluded human being desperately trying to stay relevant. Excuses after excuses and comes across as a money minded player. Disgraceful.,,Negative
Don't waste your time!,If you value your time don't waste a second on this self-indulgent drivel. The dullest sports documentary in recent times. How Amazon signed off on this god only knows.,,Negative
Pogtard Docu,"If not for anything, I blame all have rightly rated this pogtard reel the 1 star it deserved. A zero star would have been better but alas that can't be given.",,Negative
Embarrassing,Awful beyond measure. Everyone involved should be ashamed. Displays all the things that people use to beat footballers with. Offensive on multiple levels.,,Negative
Ill advised and narcissistic.,"Paul Pogba makes Mourinho look like the good guy. Something I thought impossible.

His performances for United were consistently abject. To then leave, whining that the club wouldn't pay him even more money is, frankly, insulting. Mourinho allegedly called him a virus, and, sadly, I can see why. The very last thing anyone wants to see is a preening Paul Pogba pratting around.

Ill advised and narcissistic.",,Negative
Who thought this would be a good idea?,"If you want to sit through hours of self indulgent fantasy then this is the documentary for you. I can't imagine why this was given the green light, of all the amazing players out there people would like to see a behind the scenes show on they chose pogba? Do people really want to see new haircuts and dances every show? Or listen to pogba and that fat toad of an agent he has (had) moan about how pogba isn't being played even though every time he is he underperforms?

I'll sum this up, a behind the scenes documentary about a footballer who doesn't really play football but in his (and his agents head) he's the best footballer in the world. Can't get into the first team consistently under consecutive managers due to his laziness and poor attitude but because of his flamboyant haircuts he's been given a tv show.

If you decide to watch this have some bleach on hand to wash your eyes out afterwards.",,Negative
Pograt,,,Neutral
Worst MUFC Signing,"I'd be more entertained if he backflipped off a bridge afer eating a kilo of pork. The man was completely shxt! He gave us 10% of his talent & 90% different hairstyles during his stay at Manchester United.

Q: Did he disappoint us?

A: Does a bear shxt in the woods?

Fxck You Pogba!

Sincerely, MUFC fan!",,Negative
Worst Documentary I've actually ever seen,"He's actually a quite spiteful, and unkind person. People are fighting in a war right now yet he is crying about only being offered 300k in money on a weekly basis. Shocking.",,Negative
Most useless video from a most useless Player!,"Most useless video from a most useless Player! Waste of time, he has no perspective of what he is upto in life. Do t waste your time watching this nonsense..............................................................",,Negative
Deluded beyond repair,The actual audacity of this man to make a documentary on himself shows how clearly deluded and lost in his own world this man is. Done nothing for football and is more concerned how he looks on the pitch than he does playing. I'm glad this is the worst rating ever if I could give a zero i would. Absoulty shambolic. He is a narcissistic parasite.,,Negative
No hunger,This man had potential to be one of the greatest but was greedy with not enough hunger to succeed...Viru$ as said by Mourinho. May be His agent too had part in ruining his career.,,Negative
Awful. I'd rather watch the Luke Depper life story.,"Shocking how out of touch this guy is. Thinks he's Jesus, yet has been sub par 99% of the time. This is just a series of epsisodes aimed at a failed footballer trying to hype himself up to the levels he's miserable failed to obtain. He's nothing more than average and his documentary falls even shorter than his footballing performances. Avoid if you can.",,Negative
